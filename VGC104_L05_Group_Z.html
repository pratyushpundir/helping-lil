		Use the following numbers to represent choices, similar to the previous lab:
		
			0: Rock
			1: Paper
			2: Scissors
		
		This time, you will have to edit the images in the html part manually to call 
		the play function with the appropriate argument (Hint: OnClick)
		
		Our game will progress as follows;
		
		1- When one of the images has been clicked, the play(playerChoice)function will
		be called with and argument indicating players choice.
		
		2- A choice for the CPU will be generated using the generateRandomNumber(min, max) function,
		then stored in a local variable. This function should take in 2 numbers as arguments and 
		return a number between the two, including min and max numbers.
		
		3- The calculateResult(player, cpu) function should be called with the players and the cpus choice
		as arguments. This function will use conditional statements to determine who won the game, and call
		the showPlayOnBoard(player, cpu, resultText) with the players choice, cpus choice and the result text.
		
		4- The showPlayOnBoard(player, cpu, resultText) function will use 2 conditional statements to set the 
		images on the board, and set the result text based on the arguments it was given.
